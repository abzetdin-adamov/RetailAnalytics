# Retail Sales Analytics Demo
## Introduction
This demo illustrates retail analytics using an online retail dataset containing transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. This dataset is used to demonstrate an end-to-end retail analytic use case on the Hortonworks Data Platform distribution:

* Data ingestion and cleansing using Apache Pig, 
* SQL on Hadoop using Hive
* Analytics and visualization using SparkSQL on Apache Zeppelin
* Market Basket Analysis using SparkMLLib on Apache Zeppelin

## Data set

The original Online Retail data set is available to download on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail). It has been converted using Microsoft Excel to a tab delimited file available for convenience in the current repository as [OnlineRetail.txt.zip] (https://github.com/zoharsan/RetailAnalytics/blob/master/OnlineRetail.txt.zip).
